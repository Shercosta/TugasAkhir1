"So tired of myself and my life. I wish it could change already. It feels hopeless and I don't know if I trust in anything anymore. It always has gotten worse for me. Its like a spiral down. And the shittiest is that I thought it was gonna be over soon. It isn't over.","Forgive yourself. Forgive yourself because u managed to get here. Every hardship, every time your heart got broken, every month u struggled to pay rent. We are here now. Forgive yourself for your past mistakes - the future is soft like a cushion of clouds. Believe that - that's the only way to live a happy life. Forgive."
